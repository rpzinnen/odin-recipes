    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Tasting this wonderful piece of yumyum takes you back to that caf√© in Rome, where eating this and sipping your coffee was an otherworldly redemption for your soul.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar, divided </li>
        <li>bunch of other stuff but listing them takes a lot of time</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl beat together the egg yolks and 1/3 cup of sugar. Using a wooden spoon stir in mascarpone cheese, beaten egg whites, cream and kirschwasser; stir until smooth. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Dissolve remaining 2/3 cup sugar in coffee. Quickly, to avoid complete saturation, dip ends of ladyfingers in coffee mixture. Place ladyfingers in a single layer in a 9 x 13 inch glass baking dish. Spread a layer of cheese mixture over the ladyfingers; repeat layers, ending with cheese mixture.</li>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate for several hours. Sprinkle with cocoa just before serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>And just like that, you are DONE!</h4>
